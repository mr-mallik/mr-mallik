## Databases for Large Datasets (Assessment 1 - 23rd March 2023, 11:59 PM )

#### Brief:
3 Database Models, 1 Relational (MySQL/PosgreSQL) 2 non-relational (MongoDB/Reddis/Neo4j). Each model should have a real world application case study. he case studies should be systems development projects following a real-world example where large amounts of data would be
involved. You should explain clearly why each specific DBMS would be the best for its case
study and, in the case of a NoSQL solution, why a DBMS based on the relational
model would not be the best choice. THERE IS NO NEED TO DESCRIBE THE HISTORY OR OTHER
BACKGROUND OF ANY OF THE DBMSS. **strictly 1500 words**

#### Requirements:
- Analysis of Data Models (30%)
	+ Descriptive
	+ Application/Uses
	+ Application and Usecases
- Appropriateness of Case Studies (30%)
	+ Complete Explaination
	+ Relevance of Case to Data Models
- Research (25%)
	+ Research paper articles apart from documentations
- Presentation (15%)
	+ APA 7 references
	+ No Typos
	+ All figures/images/tables/equations captioned

## Databases for Large Datasets (Assessment 2 - 5th May 2023, 11:59 PM )

#### Brief:
2 Database model implementation tutorials. The tutorial should briefly explain a suitable use case for each DBMS and then show clearly how to create and query a database. Consider professional issues surrounding the use of data and databases. **strictly 1000 words**

#### Requirements:
- Case Study (20%)
	+ Case study & discussion
	+ Discuss relevance with the dbms
	+ Mention the strength of the dbms chosen in the case study

	+ Consider reader dumb
	+ Follow a sequence
- Presentation (15%)
	+ APA 7 references
	+ No Typos
	+ All figures/images/tables/equations captioned

## Machine Learning (Assessment 1 & 2 - 27th Apr 2023, 11:59 PM )
### Application Areas:
This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at São Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital. Utilising this dataset, you are free to accomplish one of the two possible tasks below for this assignment.
- **Task 1**: Predict confirmed COVID-19 cases among suspected cases.
	- i. Based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected for a suspected COVID-19 case during a visit to the emergency room, would it be possible to predict the test result for SARS-Cov-2 (positive/negative)?
- **Task 2:** Predict admission to general ward, semi-intensive unit or intensive care unit among confirmed COVID-19 cases.
	- i. Based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected among confirmed COVID-19 cases during a visit to the emergency room, would it be possible to predict which patients will need to be admitted to a general ward, semi- intensive unit or intensive care unit?
